Mobile Makers - Wild Kingdom project.

Auto Layout & Constraints - Minimum Viable Product

As a user, I want to use the Flickr API to access the first 10 photos of lions and tigers and bears from the Flickr Creative Commons
2 POINTS
Setup a Flickr API key
Connect to the Flickr API through a url connection
As a user, I want to display the images returned from Flickr in a two column grid layout
2 POINTS
Use a UICollectionView for the grid
Create a custom UICollectionVewCell for image display
As a user, I want to tab between the lion, tiger, and bear image types
2 POINTS
Create a UITabBarController with 3 tabs
Each tab should contain either an instance of a ViewController or separate ViewControllers, one for each type of image
The preference is to use one ViewController type
As a user, I want to be able to rotate the device and have the layout change to a single roll of images that can be horizontally scrolled
3 POINTS
Using a combination of constraints / auto-layout and code, adjust the metrics of the UICollectionView when the the ViewController detects that the device has rotated
Resize the UICollectionView and re-orient the scrollDirection
